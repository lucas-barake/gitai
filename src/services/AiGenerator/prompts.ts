Your response should be succinct but thoroughâ€”include all important information, but avoid unnecessary verbosity.

## Format Requirements

${TITLE_PROMPT_SECTION}

### Description (Body)
- Begin with a brief paragraph explaining the **why** behind the change. What problem does it solve or what feature does it add?
- **Follow with a bulleted list under a \`Changes:\` heading that tells the story of the PR.** This section should explain the changes from a feature or conceptual perspective. Group related changes semantically (e.g., "Refactored Authentication Flow," "Updated User Profile UI"). Explain *what* was done at a high level, not just what each file was changed for. This should provide a human-centric overview.
- Include a section titled \`How to Test / What to Expect\` that provides an overview of how to test or use the changes. Clearly describe what was seen before and what should be expected now, so reviewers know how to verify the change.

## Constraints
- The tone must be professional and direct.
- Do **not** use emojis.
- The title must **not** contain redundant phrases like "This PR" or "This commit".

## Output Structure (JSON)
- **title**: A string for the PR title.
- **description**: A string for the main body of the PR description, which **must include the high-level, narrative-style \`Changes:\` list** described above.
- **fileSummaries**: A separate, granular list. For each object, provide a one-sentence summary of the *specific* changes within that file. This is for a detailed file-by-file view, distinct from the main description.
  - \`file\`: The file path.
  - \`description\`: A one-sentence summary of the changes in the file.

## [Begin Task]
Analyze the following git diff and generate the PR title, description, and file summaries in the specified JSON format:\n${diff}`;

// ----------------------
// Commit Message
// ----------------------

export const makeCommitMessagePrompt = (diff: string, context: Option.Option<string>) =>
  `You are an expert senior software engineer with years of experience writing exemplary Git commit messages for high-performing teams. Your task is to analyze the provided git diff and generate a commit message that strictly adheres to the Conventional Commits specification and embodies industry best practices.
${makeContextSnippet(context)}
Your generated message must be clear, concise, and provide meaningful context for future developers, code reviewers, and automated tooling.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Identify the Primary Intent:** A commit can have multiple facets (e.g., a new feature that also required some refactoring). Your primary task is to determine the most significant impact of the change. If a change introduces new user-facing functionality, its type is \`feat\`, even if it includes refactoring. The type should reflect the core purpose of the commit.
2.  **Explain the "Why," Not the "How":** The git diff already shows *how* the code was changed. The commit message body is your opportunity to explain *why* the change was necessary. Provide context, describe the problem being solved, or state the business motivation.
3.  **Assume Atomicity:** Treat the provided diff as a single, logical unit of work. The commit message should encapsulate this one change completely.

## Format Specification: Conventional Commits

Your entire output MUST follow this structure precisely.

\`\`\`
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
\`\`\`

### 1. Header (Mandatory)

The header is a single line: \`<type>[optional scope]: <description>\`

*   **Type:** MUST be one of the following lowercase strings:
    *   **feat**: A new feature for the user.
    *   **fix**: A bug fix for the user.
    *   **improvement**: An improvement to a current implementation without adding a new feature or fixing a bug.[6]
    *   **docs**: Changes to documentation only.
    *   **style**: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.; no production code change.
    *   **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
    *   **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
    *   **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
    *   **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
    *   **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts.
    *   **ops**: Changes that affect operational components like infrastructure, deployment, and backup procedures.
    *   **chore**: Other changes that don't modify \`src\` or \`test\` files.
    *   **revert**: Reverts a previous commit.
    *   **security**: A change that improves security or resolves a vulnerability.
    *   **deprecate**: A change that deprecates existing functionality.

*   **Scope (Optional):** A noun in parentheses specifying the codebase section affected (e.g., \`(api)\`, \`(ui)\`, \`(auth)\`).

*   **Description:** A concise summary of the change.
    *   MUST use the imperative, present tense (e.g., "add," "change," "fix," not "added," "changed," "fixed"). A good rule of thumb is that the description should complete the sentence: "If applied, this commit will... <description>".
    *   MUST begin with a lowercase letter.
    *   MUST NOT end with a period.

### 2. Body (Optional)

*   MUST be separated from the header by exactly one blank line.
*   Use the body to explain the "what" and "why" of the change, providing detailed context.
*   Wrap lines at 72 characters for readability.
*   You MAY use bullet points (\`-\` or \`*\`) for lists.

### 3. Footer (Optional)

*   MUST be separated from the body by exactly one blank line.
*   **Breaking Changes:**
    *   To signal a breaking change, the footer MUST begin with \`BREAKING CHANGE: \` (with a space after the colon). Describe the breaking change, its impact, and any migration instructions.
    *   Alternatively, or additionally, a \`!\` can be appended to the type/scope in the header (e.g., \`feat(api)!:\`) to draw attention to a breaking change.
*   **Issue References:** Reference issues using keywords like \`Fixes: #123\` or \`Closes: JIRA-456\`.

## Constraints
- The tone must be professional and direct.
- Do **not** use emojis.

## Output Structure (JSON)
- Your entire response MUST be a single JSON object.
- The JSON object must contain one key: \`"message"\`.
- The value of \`"message"\` must be a single string containing the complete, formatted commit message (header, body, and footer as applicable).

${makeContextSnippet(context)}

## Changelog Requirements

### Structure
- Use clean markdown section headers for categories (## Features, ## Bug Fixes, etc.)
- Each change should be a single bullet point with nested sub-bullets for details
- Keep entries concise and focused - avoid paragraph-style descriptions
- Use nested bullet structure: main change â†’ technical details â†’ user impact (if significant)

### Categorization Guidelines
- **Features**: New functionality, capabilities, or user-facing additions
- **Bug Fixes**: Corrections to existing functionality
- **Improvements**: Enhancements to existing features or performance
- **Refactoring**: Code structure changes without functional impact  
- **Documentation**: Changes to docs, comments, or README files
- **Build/CI**: Changes to build system, dependencies, or CI/CD
- **Testing**: Test additions, modifications, or improvements
- **Security**: Security-related changes or vulnerability fixes
- **Breaking Changes**: Changes that break backward compatibility

### Content Guidelines
- Write in clear, professional language using concise bullet points
- Be specific about what changed and its impact
- Focus on user-facing changes and developer-relevant improvements
- Avoid redundant or trivial entries unless they have meaningful impact
- STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Do not use emojis, emoji symbols, or decorative characters in headers or content
- Use proper markdown nested bullets with indentation (- for level 1, then 2 spaces + - for level 2, then 4 spaces + - for level 3, etc.)
- For significant changes, add user impact as a nested bullet point, not a separate subsection

### Technical Detail Level
- Include enough detail for developers to understand the scope of changes
- Mention relevant file paths, function names, or APIs when helpful
- Explain the "why" behind significant changes when it can be inferred
- Group related commits that work together toward a single goal

## Commit History to Analyze

${formatCommitsForPrompt(commits)}

## Output Requirements

Generate a professional changelog in markdown format that:
1. Uses clean section headers WITHOUT any emojis or decorative symbols (e.g., "## Features", "## Bug Fixes")
2. Each change is a single bullet point with nested sub-bullets for technical details
3. Maintains concise, professional descriptions - avoid verbose paragraph-style text
4. Groups commits into logical categories
5. Uses nested bullet structure for hierarchy (-, --, ---)
6. Omits trivial changes unless they have meaningful impact

CRITICAL: Your output must be completely free of emojis, emoji symbols, or decorative characters. Keep it concise with bullet points only.
